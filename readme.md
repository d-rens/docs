# Info

This is my repositry for notes, 25% of it made in school, the other 75% is stuff I did in free time.

It's mostly maths.

## J1
Here are my notes of the grade J1

## J2
Here are the J2 notes, also courses I have started in J1, but not finished then.


## system of the notes

The system I use consists of different smaller systems of https://castel.dev/ ,
in his blog together with his github you find the stuff detailed enough to set
it up. It got me inspired to use LaTeX for notetaking, and it's just great.
