abstract = {AbstractEcological changes in the phenology and distribution of
            plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine,
            freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are
            heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and
            have been linked to local or regional climate change through
            correlations between climate and biological variation, field and
            laboratory experiments, and physiological research.
            Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop
            species, show severe range contractions and have been the first
            groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent
            climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most
            negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions
            have been disrupted when interacting species have responded
            differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer
            conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and
            resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range
            margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate
            change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate
            negative effects at the species level.}

  abstract={There is now ample evidence of the ecological impacts of recent
            climate change, from polar terrestrial to tropical marine
            environments. The responses of both flora and fauna span an array
            of ecosystems and organizational hierarchies, from the species to
            the community levels. Despite continued uncertainty as to community
            and ecosystem trajectories under global change, our review exposes
            a coherent pattern of ecological change across systems. Although we
            are only at an early stage in the projected trends of global
            warming, ecological responses to recent climate change are already
            clearly visible.},

  abstract={Climate change over the past ∼30 years has produced numerous shifts
            in the distributions and abundances of species1,2 and has been
            implicated in one species-level extinction3. Using projections of
            species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess
            extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the
            Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which
            the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law
            relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis
            of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15--37\% of
            species in our sample of regions and taxa will be ‘committed to
            extinction’. When the average of the three methods and two
            dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios
            produce lower projections of species committed to extinction
            (∼18\%) than mid-range (∼24\%) and maximum-change (∼35\%)
            scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid
            implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions
            and strategies for carbon sequestration.}
