Inline math $E=mc^2$ is here.
Not inline math is \[E=mc^2\] is here.

Subscript: \[ a_1\] superscript: \[ a^2\] both: \[ a_1^2 \]
The scripts above were written in one line all together, but because the math is
not in \$s it does not work, here is the same thing with them.

Subscript: $a_1$ superscript: $a^2$ both: $a_1^2$

Some symbols: $\int, \cup, \cap, \oint, \coprod$.

Nested sub-\&superscript:
\[(a^n)^{r+s}=a^{nr+ns}\]

\section{more complicated maths}
\[\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\] 

\[\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
=\prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}
\]

\[
\sin(a+b)=\sin(a)\cos(b)+\cos(a)\sin(b)
\]

\[
\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\]

\section{now some stuff with amsmath}

\[
\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Fractions can be used alongside the text, for example $frac{1}{2}$, and in a
mathematical display style like the one below: \[\frac{1}{2}\]

Fractions can also be nested inside of each other:
\[
a_0\cfrac{1}{a_1+\cfrac{1}{a_2+\cfrac{1}{a_3+\cdots}}}
\]

\LaTeX has some brackets:

(x+y)
[x+y]
\{x+y\}
$\langle x+y \rangle$
|x+y|
$\|x+y\|$


\[
F=G \left(\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \right )
\]

\section{matrices, but still no idea what they even do}
$
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{matrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{Bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{Bmatrix}
$\\
The matrices above are from left to right:\\ matrix, pmatrix, bmatrix and Bmatrix.

\section{practice}
Goal is to do the practice without the internet,\\
just with the notes above and common sense.\\

1:
\[Loss=Bias^2+Variance^2+noise\]

2:
\[Chi
=\frac{(y-y^2)}{\sqrt{x}}
=\frac{\delta}{\sqrt{y}}\]

Had to look up how to square-root something, i assumed root, not sqrt.
\\
3:
\[f(x)\leftarrow \frac{\Sigma f(x)}{k}\]
\[DE(x_i ,x_j)=\sqrt{(x_i -x_j)^2+(y_{xi}-y_{xj})^2}\]

4:
\[\frac{1}{1+e^{-(wx+b)}}\]

5:
\[R^2=\frac{n \Sigma xy - \Sigma x.\Sigma y}{\sqrt{(n \Sigma x^2 -(\Sigma x)^2).
(n \Sigma y^2-(\Sigma y)^2)}}\]


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Neue Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{other tests}
\[\sqrt{x}=x^{\frac{1}{2}}\]
