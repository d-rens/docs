\section{Introduction}
Complex numbers are a type of number that extends the real numbers. A complex
number is a number of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and
$i$ is the imaginary unit, which is defined as $\sqrt{-1}$. The real part of a
complex number is the coefficient of the real unit, which is $a$, and the
imaginary part is the coefficient of the imaginary unit, which is $b$. The set
of complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{C}$. 

Complex numbers can be represented graphically on a complex plane, where the
horizontal axis represents the real part and the vertical axis represents the
imaginary part. The modulus or absolute value of a complex number is the
distance from the origin to the point representing the complex number on the
complex plane, and is given by $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. The conjugate of
a complex number $a + bi$ is the number $a - bi$. 

Complex numbers are used in many areas of mathematics and science, such as in
electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and signal processing. They also
have important applications in geometry and in the study of functions of a
complex variable.

\section{Complex Numbers}
Complex numbers are numbers of the form $a + bi$,
where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit, which is
defined as $\sqrt{-1}$. Complex numbers can be represented graphically on a
complex plane, with the real part of the number plotted on the horizontal axis
and the imaginary part plotted on the vertical axis. The modulus or absolute
value of a complex number is the distance from the origin to the point
representing the complex number on the complex plane, and is given by $|a + bi|
= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. The conjugate of a complex number $a + bi$ is the number
$a - bi$. The sum, difference, product, and quotient of two complex numbers can
be calculated using the rules of algebra.

\subsection{Addition and Subtraction}
  To add or subtract two complex numbers, we add or subtract their real and
  imaginary parts separately. If $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2i$ are
  two complex numbers, then their sum is $z_1 + z_2 = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 +
  b_2)i$, and their difference is $z_1 - z_2 = (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)i$.

\subsection{Multiplication}
To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the fact
that $i^2 = -1$. If $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2i$ are two complex
numbers, then their product is given by:

$z_1 \cdot z_2 = (a_1 + b_1i)(a_2 + b_2i) = a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i + b_1a_2i + b_1b_2i^2$

Using the fact that $i^2 = -1$, we can simplify this to:

$z_1 \cdot z_2 = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + b_1a_2)i$

So the real part of the product is the product of the real parts minus the
product of the imaginary parts, and the imaginary part of the product is the
sum of the product of the real part of one number and the imaginary part of the
other, where the imaginary part of the first is multiplied by the real part of
the second.


\subsection{Division}
To divide two complex numbers, we use the fact that we can multiply the
numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which will
eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator. If $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2
= a_2 + b_2i$ are two complex numbers, then their quotient is given by:

\[
\dfrac{z_1}{z_2} = \dfrac{a_1 + b_1i}{a_2 + b_2i} = \dfrac{(a_1 + b_1i)(a_2 - b_2i)}{(a_2 + b_2i)(a_2 - b_2i)}
\]

Expanding the numerator and denominator, we get:

\[
\dfrac{z_1}{z_2} = \dfrac{(a_1a_2 + b_1b_2) + (b_1a_2 - a_1b_2)i}{a_2^2 + b_2^2}
\]

So the real part of the quotient is the product of the real parts plus the
product of the imaginary parts, divided by the modulus of the denominator, and
the imaginary part of the quotient is the product of the real part of the first
number and the imaginary part of the second, minus the product of the imaginary
part of the first number and the real part of the second, divided by the
modulus of the denominator.



\section{Polar Form of Complex Numbers}
The polar form of a complex number is a way of expressing a complex number
using its modulus and argument. If $z = a + bi$ is a complex number, then its
modulus $|z|$ is given by $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and its argument $\theta$ is
the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin and
the point representing the complex number on the complex plane. The argument is
usually measured in radians and is denoted by $\theta$. 

The polar form of the complex number $z$ is then given by:

$z = |z| \cdot (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$

This is also known as the exponential form of the complex number. It can also
be written as $z = r e^{i\theta}$, where $r = |z|$ is the modulus and
$e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$ is known as the complex exponential
or Euler's formula. 

The polar form of a complex number is useful in performing multiplication and
division of complex numbers, as well as in finding roots of complex numbers. It
also provides a geometric interpretation of complex numbers, where the modulus
represents the distance from the origin and the argument represents the angle
of rotation.


\subsection{Conversion to Polar Form}
To convert a complex number from rectangular form to polar form, we need to
find its modulus and argument. If $z = a + bi$ is a complex number, then its
modulus $|z|$ is given by $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and its argument $\theta$ is
given by $\theta = \operatorname{arctan}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$, where
$\operatorname{arctan}$ is the inverse tangent function.

If $a$ is positive, then $\theta$ is the angle between the positive real axis
and the line connecting the origin and the point representing the complex
number on the complex plane. If $a$ is negative, then we need to add $\pi$ to
the argument to get the correct angle. If $a$ is zero and $b$ is positive, then
the argument is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and if $a$ is zero and $b$ is negative, then
the argument is $-\frac{\pi}{2}$.

Once we have found the modulus and argument, we can express the complex number
in polar form as:

$z = |z| \cdot (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$

Alternatively, we can express it in exponential form as:

$z = |z| \cdot e^{i\theta}$

These forms are useful in performing multiplication and division of complex
numbers, as well as in finding roots of complex numbers.


\section{Euler's Formula}
Euler's formula is a mathematical identity that relates the exponential
function to the trigonometric functions. It is given by:

$e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$

where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $\theta$ is an angle in radians. This
formula is also known as the complex exponential function.

Euler's formula is useful in expressing complex numbers in polar form, as well
as in solving differential equations and in the study of Fourier series. It
provides a connection between the exponential function, which is a fundamental
function in calculus and analysis, and the trigonometric functions, which are
fundamental in geometry and periodic functions.

\section{Complex Conjugate}
The complex conjugate of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is the number $\overline{z} = a - bi$. In other words, it is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the number. 

The complex conjugate of a complex number has several important properties. First, the product of a complex number and its conjugate is always a real number, given by:

\[
z \cdot \overline{z} = |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

Second, the sum or difference of a complex number and its conjugate is always a real number, given by:

\[z + \overline{z} = 2a\]

\[
z - \overline{z} = 2bi
\]


Third, a complex number is equal to its conjugate if and only if it is real,
that is, if its imaginary part is zero. 

The complex conjugate is also useful in finding roots of complex numbers and in
performing division of complex numbers, as it allows us to eliminate the
imaginary part in the denominator.

\subsection{Properties}
The complex conjugate of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is the number
$\overline{z} = a - bi$, where the sign of the imaginary part is changed. Some
properties of the complex conjugate are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The conjugate of a real number is itself. That is, if $z = a$ is a real number, then $\overline{z} = a$.
    \item The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number. That is, $z \cdot \overline{z} = |z|^2$, where $|z|$ is the modulus of $z$.
    \item The sum and difference of two complex numbers and their conjugates are real and imaginary, respectively. That is, if $z_1 = a_1 + b_1i$ and $z_2 = a_2 + b_2i$, then $(z_1 + z_2) + (\overline{z_1}+\overline{z_2})$ is real, and $(z_1 - z_2) - (\overline{z_1}-\overline{z_2})$ is imaginary.
    \item The conjugate of a product is equal to the product of the conjugates in reverse order. That is, $(z_1 \cdot z_2)^* = \overline{z_2} \cdot \overline{z_1}$.
    \item The conjugate of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the conjugates in reverse order. That is, $\left(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right)^* = \frac{\overline{z_1}}{\overline{z_2}}$, where $z_2 \neq 0$. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Applications}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Electrical engineering: Complex numbers are used to represent the amplitude and phase of electrical signals in AC circuits. They also play a key role in the analysis of filters, amplifiers, and control systems.
    \item Quantum mechanics: Complex numbers are used to represent the wave function of quantum particles, which describes the probability of finding a particle in a certain state. They are also used to represent the operators that act on these wave functions.
    \item Signal processing: Complex numbers are used to represent signals in the frequency domain, which allows for efficient processing of signals using Fourier transforms. They are also used in digital signal processing, where complex signals are manipulated using complex arithmetic operations.
    \item Geometry: Complex numbers can be used to represent points in the complex plane, which allows for a geometric interpretation of complex arithmetic operations. They are also used in the study of conformal mappings, which are mappings that preserve angles and shapes.
    \item Functions of a complex variable: Complex numbers are used in the study of functions of a complex variable, which are functions that map complex numbers to complex numbers. They are used to define concepts such as analyticity, holomorphy, and singularities, which have important applications in many areas of mathematics and physics.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Modulus and Argument}
The modulus of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 +
b^2}$. It represents the distance of $z$ from the origin in the complex plane.

The argument of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $\arg(z) =
\tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)$. It represents the angle that the line
connecting the origin and $z$ makes with the positive real axis in the complex
plane. The argument is usually given in radians.

\subsection{Modulus}
The modulus of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

\subsection{Argument}
The argument of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $\arg(z) =
\tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)$.

\subsection{Properties}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The modulus of a complex number is always non-negative: $|z| \geq 0$.
    \item The modulus of a complex number is zero if and only if the complex number itself is zero: $|z| = 0 \iff z = 0$.
    \item The product of two complex numbers is equal to the product of their moduli: $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| \cdot |z_2|$.
    \item The quotient of two complex numbers is equal to the quotient of their moduli: $\left|\dfrac{z_1}{z_2}\right| = \dfrac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}$, provided $z_2 \neq 0$.
    \item The argument of a complex number is not unique, since the tangent function has a period of $\pi$. In other words, if $\theta$ is an argument of $z$, then so is $\theta + k\pi$, where $k$ is any integer.
    \item If $z$ is a non-zero complex number, then it can be written in polar form as $z = |z|(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$, where $\theta$ is an argument of $z$.
    \item The argument of a product of two complex numbers is equal to the sum of their arguments: $\arg(z_1 z_2) = \arg(z_1) + \arg(z_2)$, provided the arguments are taken in the same range.
    \item The argument of a quotient of two complex numbers is equal to the difference of their arguments: $\arg\left(\dfrac{z_1}{z_2}\right) = \arg(z_1) - \arg(z_2)$, provided the arguments are taken in the same range and $z_2 \neq 0$.
\end{enumerate}

    
\section{Complex Functions}
A complex function is defined as $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$, where $z = x + iy$
is a complex number, and $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are real-valued functions of $x$
and $y$.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Holomorphic function: A complex function is said to be holomorphic or analytic in a region of the complex plane if it is differentiable at every point in that region.
\item Meromorphic function: A complex function is said to be meromorphic in a region of the complex plane if it is analytic except for a finite number of isolated singularities.
\item Entire function: A complex function is said to be entire if it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane.
\item Rational function: A complex function is said to be rational if it can be expressed as the ratio of two polynomials.
\item Periodic function: A complex function is said to be periodic if it satisfies the condition $f(z + T) = f(z)$ for some complex number $T$ and all $z$ in the domain of $f$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Complex Derivatives}
The complex derivative of a complex function $f(z)$ is defined as:

\[
f'(z) = \lim\limits_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta z) - f(z)}{\Delta z}
\]

where $\Delta z$ is a complex number approaching 0. If this limit exists, then
the function is said to be complex differentiable at $z$, and $f'(z)$ is the
complex derivative of $f(z)$ at $z$.

The Cauchy-Riemann equations provide a useful tool for determining when a
function is complex differentiable. If a function $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is
differentiable at a point $z = x + iy$, then the partial derivatives of $u$ and
$v$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\]

If these equations hold at a point, then $f(z)$ is complex differentiable at
that point, and its complex derivative is given by:

\[
f'(z) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + i\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\]


\section{Complex Roots}
A complex number $w$ is said to be a complex root of a polynomial $p(z)$ if
$p(w) = 0$. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant
polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.

If $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, then it can be factored as:

$$p(z) = c(z - w_1)(z - w_2)\cdots(z - w_n)$$

where $c$ is a constant, and $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are the complex roots of
$p(z)$. Note that a complex root may appear multiple times in the factorization
if it has multiplicity greater than 1.

To find the complex roots of a polynomial, we can use various methods such as
the quadratic formula for quadratic polynomials, or the cubic formula and
quartic formula for cubic and quartic polynomials, respectively. However, for
polynomials of higher degree, there is no general formula that can express the
roots in terms of radicals.

Instead, we can use numerical methods such as Newton's method or the
Durand-Kerner method to approximate the roots of a polynomial. These methods
involve starting with an initial guess for a root, and then iteratively
refining the guess until it converges to a root of the polynomial.

\subsection{Square Roots}
Given a complex number $z$, a square root of $z$ is a complex number $w$ such
that $w^2 = z$. Note that there are two possible square roots of a non-zero
complex number $z$, namely $w$ and $-w$.

To find the square roots of a complex number $z$, we can use the following
formula:

$$w = \pm \sqrt{r}\left(\cos\frac{\theta}{2} + i\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$$

where $z = r\operatorname{cis}\theta$ is the polar form of $z$, and
$\operatorname{cis}\theta = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$ is the complex
exponential function. Here, we take the positive square root if we want the
principal square root of $z$.

Alternatively, we can use the quadratic formula to find the square roots of a
complex number $z = a + bi$:

$$w = \pm\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + a}{2}} + i\,\operatorname{sgn}(b)\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - a}{2}}$$

where $\operatorname{sgn}(b)$ is the sign function, which is equal to 1 if $b$
is positive, and -1 if $b$ is negative.

Note that if $z$ is a non-zero complex number, then its square roots are always
distinct, unless $z$ is a non-zero real number.



\subsection{Cube Roots}
Given a complex number $z$, a cube root of $z$ is a complex number $w$ such
that $w^3 = z$. Note that there are three possible cube roots of a non-zero
complex number $z$.

To find the cube roots of a complex number $z$, we can use the following
formula:

$$w_k = \sqrt[3]{|z|}\left(\cos\frac{\operatorname{Arg}(z) + 2\pi k}{3} + i\sin\frac{\operatorname{Arg}(z) + 2\pi k}{3}\right)$$

where $|z|$ is the modulus of $z$, $\operatorname{Arg}(z)$ is the principal
argument of $z$ (i.e., the argument in the interval $(-\pi,\pi]$), and $k = 0,
1, 2$.

Alternatively, we can use the following formula to find the principal cube root
of a complex number $z = a + bi$:

$$w = \sqrt[3]{\frac{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}+a}{2}} + i\frac{\operatorname{sgn}(b)\sqrt[3]{\left|\frac{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}-a}{2}\right|}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

where $\operatorname{sgn}(b)$ is the sign function, which is equal to 1 if $b$
is positive, and -1 if $b$ is negative.

Note that if $z$ is a non-zero complex number, then its cube roots are always
distinct, unless $z$ is a non-zero real number.


\section{Applications of Complex Numbers}
\subsection{Electrical Engineering}
Complex numbers have many applications in electrical engineering, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item AC circuit analysis: In AC circuit analysis, complex numbers are used to represent the amplitudes and phases of sinusoidal signals. This allows us to analyze circuits with resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and determine their behavior under different operating conditions.
\item Impedance and admittance: Complex numbers are used to represent the impedance and admittance of circuits, which are important parameters in AC circuit analysis. Impedance is the complex-valued counterpart of resistance, and admittance is the complex-valued counterpart of conductance.
\item Phasor analysis: Phasor analysis is a technique used in AC circuit analysis to simplify the analysis of circuits with sinusoidal signals. It involves representing sinusoidal signals as complex numbers, and performing circuit analysis using complex arithmetic.
\item Control systems: Complex numbers are used in control systems to represent the frequency response of a system, which is a measure of how the system responds to sinusoidal inputs at different frequencies. The frequency response is represented using a complex function called the transfer function.
\item Signal processing: Complex numbers are used in signal processing to represent signals in the frequency domain, using a complex function called the Fourier transform. This allows us to analyze signals in terms of their frequency components, and perform filtering operations to remove unwanted frequencies.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Signal Processing}
Signal processing is a field of study that deals with the analysis, modification, and synthesis of signals such as sound, images, and biological signals. Complex algebra plays a crucial role in signal processing applications. Here are some examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fourier analysis: The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool used in signal processing to transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. It is defined as follows:
$$\mathcal{F}(f(t))(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-i\omega t}dt$$
where $f(t)$ is the signal in the time domain, $\mathcal{F}(f(t))(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the signal in the frequency domain, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The Fourier transform is used for applications such as filtering, compression, and feature extraction.
\item Digital signal processing: Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing techniques to manipulate signals. Complex algebra is used in DSP for operations such as filtering, convolution, and correlation. For example, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a digital version of the Fourier transform, which is used extensively in DSP.
\item Image processing: Image processing is the analysis and manipulation of digital images. Complex algebra is used in image processing for operations such as filtering, convolution, and Fourier analysis. For example, the 2D Fourier transform is used to analyze the frequency content of an image.
\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, complex algebra plays a critical role in signal processing applications, from Fourier analysis to digital signal processing and image processing.

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory of physics that describes the
behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. Complex
algebra plays a central role in the mathematical formalism of quantum
mechanics. Here are some examples of applications of complex algebra in quantum
mechanics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wave functions: The wave function is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the quantum state of a particle. It is a complex-valued function that satisfies the Schrödinger equation. The probability density of finding a particle at a certain location is given by the squared modulus of the wave function. Complex algebra is used to manipulate wave functions, compute probabilities, and solve the Schrödinger equation.
\item Operators: Operators are mathematical objects that represent physical observables in quantum mechanics. They act on wave functions and return another wave function or a scalar value. Operators can be represented as matrices, and complex algebra is used to manipulate them, compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and perform operations such as normalization and projection.
\item Quantum states: Quantum states are described by complex vectors in a Hilbert space. They can be represented using bra-ket notation, where the bra represents the complex conjugate of a vector and the ket represents the vector itself. Complex algebra is used to manipulate quantum states, perform measurements, and compute probabilities.
\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, complex algebra is an essential tool for the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. It is used to manipulate wave functions, operators, and quantum states, compute probabilities, and solve the Schrödinger equation.
