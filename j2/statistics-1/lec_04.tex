\section{Counting}

\paragraph{Coin \& Die: }
Outcomes: two for coin, six for die. Thoes together have 12 outcomes.

\subsection{Fundamental counting rule}
If you have an event that can occur ``m'' ways and another event that can occur ``n'' ways, then together they can occur $m\cdot n$ ways.

\ex{Four number security code
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1^{st}$ digit can't be zero.
\end{itemize}

        \[ 9\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10 = 9000 .\] 
    probability of guessing: $\frac{1}{9000}$ }

If you have different arangements, which are all unique it's like the following.
Given you have 5 unique items, you can have $5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1=120$ different arrangements.
In conclusion, if you have 5 unique things, there are $5!$ constelations, if you have 10 unique things there are $10!$ constelations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Remember: $0! = 1$
    \item for any set of ``$n$'' \textbf{different} items, there are $n!$ different arrangements possible.
\end{itemize}

\ex{ There are 7 cool rides at D.L., how many different ways could you write all seven?

$7!=5040$
