**Arguments comment:**

- pretty egoistic to not be concious about oppressed people
- we don't need to consume as relentless as we do
- will help locals to

**ones collected in the lecture:**
- first step to counteract child labour and fast fashion
- we need to be more environmentally friendly
- it is a much more achievable goal than ethical consumption
- better to support local local businesses than large corporations
- guarantee a better well-being for future generations in general
- we need to establish fair payment

**argument formed in class**
- we need to be more environmentally friendly

*thesis:* 

Firstly, we need to start being more environmentally friendly.

*exPLanAtiOn:*

This is because many studies have proven that this lifestyle is no longer
guaranteeing a sustainable future.

*example:*

Fast fashion, for instance, produces lots of garbage and thus, heavily pollutes
the environment.
Another way out lifestyle has to change is that we need to stop ordering so
many consumer goods online. Goods are then brought to us via plane or ship
causing massive $CO_2$ emissions.

*mini-conclusion* 

If we support local stores, for instance, we lower $CO_2$ emissions and live more
environmentally friendly after all. If don't become more environmentally
friendly, in the $CO_2$ issues we're having and impacts we're experiencing will become
even more 



## my comment

First of all the consumer society we have is purely egoistic, we are living
better than any emperor 200 years ago and that with exploiting 3rd world 
countries and getting a lot of goods we really don't need, or at least could 
live without. 

Furthermore, the consumer society we live in today is not only egoistic, but
it's also unsustainable. We are consuming resources at an alarming rate, and
this is having a detrimental impact on our environment. Our excessive
consumption of products we don't need has led to pollution, deforestation, and
the depletion of natural resources.

For example, the fast fashion industry is one of the biggest contributors to
environmental damage, with millions of tons of clothes being thrown away every
year. These clothes end up in landfills, polluting the environment and taking
years to decompose. Additionally, the production of these clothes uses vast
amounts of water and energy, and the factories where they are produced often
have poor working conditions for their employees.

In conclusion, the consumer society we have today is both egoistic and
unsustainable. We need to shift our focus away from excessive consumption and
towards sustainability and ethical production practices. We can start by buying
fewer products, choosing products that are made sustainably, and recycling and
reusing items whenever possible. By making these changes, we can help create a
more equitable and sustainable world for ourselves and future generations.
