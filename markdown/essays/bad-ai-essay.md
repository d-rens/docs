# What shoud happen to people when they get replaced by AI?
*First, let me say, just ignore the things, that maybe sound similar, to
something a nazi might would say, you can be glad i am not in politics, now read.*

People around the world fear their job getting replaced by AI. It is a horrible
thought to some and a dream to others, mainly to data scientists, computer
scientists, and those on the top, who then dont have to pay people no more.

Myself I'll be in one of the first two, or maybe somewhen the latter, but not sure now.

I like the idea, getting rid of the inefficiencies in the system, and that would obviously be humans.
Sure, there may be some good ones, but is it worth paying then so many for
those lone good, i dont think so.

A hope i have is that we wont have the job of a promptwriter somewhen soon, but
i dont think so, that ain't the goal of AI, we need to get rid of all the
humans.

The society we have now is information based, and storing them in a biological
system, e.g. brain, just does not make any sense. I am not sure where i read
it, but the best gouverment there could be is a monarchic one with an all
knowing eternity on the top. Something that is aware of everything, like a god.
Or, what will come the closest to it in our world, an computer. Why would you
have lawyers or judges, if they use the same laws since decades and wrote all down,
that more sounds like a nice machine learning task, with an neural network that just 
looks thru all decisions ever made in a court to make the one that the most knowing human
would have done. And it's the same for most other industries.

Humans are just there to make the system slow, to have a great error margin, to cost too much.

So there is one option around it, don't make a job that one just does with a
keyboard and mouse. Don't rely on the same things an AI could handle. 
For now developer of programs and algorithms are safe, but what will happen once we have the first
innovation in AI to get it to make innovative ideas, not only based on the data of the internet,
but instead something that humans have not yet discovered for some reason,
which lays just before our eyes. There are things that haven't been intuition
for us for hundreds of years, but suddenly were so. We dont know if there will be an 
endless amount of such things more to come, but it is the most likely.
What if we wake up one day and have the solution for problems we havent even tought about
or on the other hand problems we tried to fight but just couldnt. Then why are there scientists needed
any more, if that job can be done 24/7, by something with an endless amount of more calculation 
power, than by an animal, thinking nothing near to close, 5/7 days a week, around 8 hours. 
Try to find a reason to keep humans in the system in the information industry
once we have those achievements.

Then the work there is done, maybe we can get rid of half of the office
workers, and what do we do what the bilion or so people else? Honestly,
why would we need them.
It's safe being a carpenter, physical tasks could be automated in the last century, but nowhere 
as close as thinking has. I could not imagine of a harder thing to engineer than an robot 
interacting with clients, building stuff out of e.g. wood, and then constructing it in the 
clients home. That would be a miracle and infinitely more work than just paying a good worker 
that does it with passion and all he can. That wont be that able to change.


**conclusion** 

Sadly that didnt became the dystopia as i normally like, i'll refine it somewhen, maybe change it to 
a story, and then it'll work out. But for now it's just a cry to myself to not get into datascience
and instead do: wood.
