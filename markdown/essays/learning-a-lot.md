# learning a lot just to knowing nothing

Since some months my life became learning, in most of it's faucets.
Going to school daily, self-studying, reading books, taking courses,
reading more books and alike. This all on one hand got me familiar with
a lot of things i did not know anything about before, e.g. Australia,
Spanish, Norwegian, Document writing with LaTeX, classics of
literature a lot of mathematics... You can probably see where this is
going, but i've never managed to dive really deep into one topic.
Web-development i did html5, css3, bootstrap and then got bored and
never touched it ever since, in maths i did a Algebra, Trigonometry
and half of a Calculus 1 course but never did it any further,
literature i read some of the most important titles but never read a
book twice or read it very carefully. Getting to know topics often
after a little time just gets me overwhelmed, which makes me then
quit. In web-dev there are more than 10 often used languages i don't
care for
so i saw i'll not be able to get ever good at it -> stopped. In maths i
will continue, but even if i'd do a pure math degree i'd still know
nothing because it's one of the biggest and certainly most complex
topics that even exist and on literature i would maybe like to dive into
some works but fear of missing out, why should i read a book exactly,
multible times if i could in the same time read works of multible
authors i did not even knew about beforehand? 
just seems like a waste of time if i am not sure if i'll actually need
the deep knowledge.

But now i end up having a broad understanding of topics, but if one
would ask me a question i could not answer it, because it's not too
clearly in my head and just aimlessly floating around waiting do be
either used, advanced or just to vanish. Am i in the wrong, should i
stop? Should i dive into topics instead of not being able to wait,
reaching for the next topic before having not even nearly finished the
one i am on at that point in time?

Personally i've always put it down as "i better learn on a broad
spectrum to know little about a lot than actually diving into something
to not waste time and get to know everything i am not familiar with
yet". But is this the way to go? Or will i just end up loosing every
concept i learned about, just because i don't use it or learn it?
What is the alternative? Studying or refreshing topics i learned in the
past regularly to remember them, but still don't use them?
Or should i just stick to topics, getting into those i actually care
about and nothing else? Missing out on stuff that interests me, but just
on the side?

i don't know

I am not sure what to do, i will probably just continue doing it as i do
it now, getting the broad knowledge, to pick it up fast whenever i need
it and being able to dive into it.
