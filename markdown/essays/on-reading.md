# on reading
Reading is this great thing, where an author spends months up to years just to
research a topic, become the expert on the topic, to then share the most
essential that he gathered to be published in a book, accessible to all. And
then, you the reader, can read all that, about all the knowledge the expert
told you about in a week, a day, or if you are the most interested in just one
sitting. And afterwards you *know more about it?* Yeah, that's as easy as it
can get.

You can just read the book on the go and afterwards know some more things, or
you can study it, if it's the right book, then become an expert yourself.

But why is it then, that not everybody reads, furthermore why is it then, that
not everybody reads all the time.

Not sure if I'll be able to answer that question, but I'll try my best.

I can start with me as an example, which is fair, because I am accidentally the
person I know the most about.

So, I know that one should read more, I know what immense knowledge a book can
bring to a person. So now's the question why don't I then read all the time?
Starting with some facts, I read around a book a week. Most genres from plays
to scientific literature (generally said, I just try to read all things that
are worth to be read). At the moment I am going thru Dostoevsky's works with
some plays in between to not get used to an great as great as Dostoevsky.

Further, I mostly read on my commute, around 95% mostly, the commute is around
two hours each weekday which is a fair bit, but why don't I read more.
I asked that myself a good amount of times but never really thought about it
too much. Until today (2023-02-11) which you might get, because you are just
reading this essay I wrote to think about it on paper. I came up with the
thought while listening the Lex Friedman Podcast he did with Steven Bonnell,
they talked about reading along the lines of 'just read all the time, LIKE all
all the time, and you'll have insane knowledge that will really bring you
ahead'. And I thought, yeah, they're right, fuck, why don't I read all the time.
And I can't exactly answer that, I can say what I do instead tho: I waste time.

Thinking about stuff as myself just being pathetic helped me a lot in other
cases, talking down on myself for not being efficient, not read well enough...
it always helped. So now I just do that with reading, until I read at least 4
hours every day. Not because I have to do it, or me getting myself to do it.
Just somewhen getting into it and never out again, because it's certainly, the
one, right thing to do.

I started reading less than a year ago, and since then read about 40 books which 
already made a huge change in my life. If I just think of that being x5 then I am 
just sorry to myself for having wasted time not reading. Not that studying
instead would be inherently bad, but we all know that ain't the case, and even if 
I sometimes stopped studying for school because that's a waste of time too, but
that's another topic.

So just summarising what we have 'til now:
We are all fucking pathetic for wasting time on not reading.

Let me just say, I don't blame you for not reading all the time if you have not
started, then I can just tell you to start, it's great, it's the best thing
there is to do or you could do for yourself, then everything is still open,
maybe, once you picked up the right book you'll never stop again, but now I am
here talking about those who already know and don't do it.

My personal goal in life (at least before having people to care for and alike),
is to be efficient and to learn. And reading is the perfect thing that is both.
And I still don't fucking do it as much as I would want to because I rather
waste time on watching useless videos.


##### In Conclusion
We are all fucking pathetic, we need to get rid of inefficiencies, we need to read instead of life, you should hate yourself if your goal is not to spend all your time reading, and even if you have this goal and still don't do it.

Have a nice day.
