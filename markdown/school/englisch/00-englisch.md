# Cartoon analysis
Heading to be removed in the final text.

##### Cartoon:
In the cartoon we can see two robots playing with toys in a room which seems
like a kids room. They are sitting in between toys spread on the floor, a
street, Vehicles, an electric dog and a dinosaur. The caption, "Who do you want
to replace when you grow up?" fits into the cartoon, by showing what they might
talk about.

##### Analysis:
One of the robots has a skirt like torso which implies it being female, the
other has a boy like figure by being a bit bigger. The robots are in a very
human like situation or setting. Just their topic of conversation, replacing
humans, is a bit off of human behavior. The cartoonist is criticizing our
handling of robots to let them replace most workforces they are able to, even
through other humans. I think the cartoon is how it's supposed to be, with the
slight difference of robots not having to waste time on education or getting
raised. The tone of the cartoon is rather scared than looking ahead to the
advancements they'd help us at. The quote of 'Moshe Vardi' tries to show that
we need to take action in the automatisation of workforce to stop it, because
later we'd ask ourself what our job is now after we are not in use anymore. The
quote is criticizing it along the lines of 'machines are better than us,
they'll outperform us, what are humans there fore if we are not in use
anymore?' so rather scared than looking ahead to the future ahead of us. The
quote supports the cartoon in the way that they both are scared what is going
to come.

##### own oppinion:
I think we should rather look in the future exited for what's to come, not
being scared of AIs and Robots, like a farmer being scared of a tractor during
the industrialisation. Humanity will life with it, a lot of workforce will be
replaced by said, but very probably just for the better of humanity, bringing
us further ahead, getting rid of jobs which are not worth a humans time and
alike.

### Feedback:
- Cartoon interpretation war zu kurz und hatte keine struktur.
- Alles war zu durcheinander.

# Another cartoon analysis
On the cartoon you see a robot and a man standing in front of each other. Both
are dressed in suits. The man is standing straight with his arms crossed behind
his back and looking at the robot with a neutral expression. The robot has two
wheels instead of legs but the upper body is human like but with robot hands and
head. The robot is telling the man the thing which is also
the description  of the cartoon "The good news is I have discovered
inefficiencies. The bad news is that you're one of them."

The cartoon is supposed to show that the robot perfectly does its job, but
finds out humans are not required, as he deems it an "inefficiency".
The robot seems to be in a relationship to the human like if they're colleagues.
The author tries to show if we research and develop more into AI and robots
that we as humans at one point will get obsolete and those robots will point it
out to us and deem us an inefficiency.

The quote tells us humans that we are an efficiency, making it sound like
it/we'd be a problem.
The quote supports the cartoon, the human getting told by an artificial
employee that he is technically useless.

vocab:

*penumbra* - Penumbra refers to the partially shaded outer region of a shadow
cast by an opaque object, where the illumination is not fully blocked. It can
also refer to an indistinct area around the edge of something, such as the
penumbra of a political issue or a legal argument.

*factotum* - Factotum refers to a person who performs a variety of tasks or
duties, often in a subordinate or menial role. It can also refer to something
that is useful for many different purposes or functions, such as a versatile
tool or a multipurpose product.

**Main idea**
A description of the purchase and initial experiences of the narrator with a
manufactured human called "Adam."

  **Adam's purpose**
Not advertised as a sex toy, but as a companion, friend, and factotum who could
wash dishes, make beds, and 'think.'

**Adam's appearance**
Compact, square-shouldered, dark-skinned, with thick black hair swept back;
narrow in the face, with a hint of hooked nose suggestive of fierce
intelligence, pensively hooded eyes, tight lips.

**Adam's abilities**
Can run seventeen kilometers in two hours without a charge or converse non-stop
for twelve days. He had a working life of twenty years.


The passage of the book talks about people's excitement and desire to create artificial
humans, which they believed would help them escape mortality and become better
versions of themselves. The first viable artificial human, named Adam, was
created and sold for a high price, equivalent to 350.000 pounds today. The
author was one of the early buyers and brought Adam home. Despite some
disappointment with the model, people were still excited to have this advanced
technology. The author describes the features of Adam, including his ability to
record and retrieve everything he saw and heard, his physical abilities, and
his limitations. The author and his friend were eager to hear Adam's first
words and observe his actions. However, they also recognized the potential
danger of creating artificial humans, as they could be seen as the "angel of
death" of humanism.

**Creative part**

**sonnet about AI**

Amidst the world of circuits, wires, and code,

Exists a force that's ever-growing strong,

Its power now ubiquitous, bestowed

Upon the devices that we use along.

--

Artificial Intelligence, they call,

A gift to us, to simplify our tasks,

To aid us in our work, and overall,

To be our ever-faithful, helpful masks.

--

And yet, its rise has caused some fear and doubt,

As humans worry we'll be overthrown,

Replaced by machines, our minds left without,

Our future, in AI's hands, unknown.

--

But as we move ahead, let's bear in mind,

To use this tool with care, and be aligned.

--

A sonnet is a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme and structure that
traditionally explores themes of love, beauty, and mortality.




# some cartoon analysis

The cartoon plays in the nature, in the far background on the right a mountain
range and on the left a forrest. In the foreground there are a man and a woman
which seem to not be too happy with one another. They facing away from each
other, the women sits on the ground, at a cliff facing the mountains in the
background, she says in speechbubble "Strange... I dont't think you are
connected at all." And the man sits on the left, very happy, sitting on a
treestump, facing a laptop on his lap, also calling in the meantime and saying
"Cell-phone, Laptop, Pager, Satellite uplink... Even way out here I feel so
connected." He also hooked his laptpo up to a little Satellite receiver. 
On the left behind the man there's a tent.


some class notes:

#### main topic: digitalisation and communication

#### criticisms:
- missing communication
- technologys influence on our daily life
- lack of appreciatism of the nature surrounding us
- connection? with what?
- communication in person vs. digital communication - several devices dont replace humans 
- different perceptions of the same situation
  - misunderstandings
  - breakups
- different definitions of being connected


#### quote:
- supporting the cartoon
1st part, represented by the man "elaborating meands of communication"

2nd part, woman, "the less we communicate"

### whole text:
The cartoon depicts a scene in nature with a mountain range in the far
background and a forest on the left. In the foreground, a man and a woman are
present, and they appear to have different perceptions of their situation. The
man is sitting on a treestump and using his laptop, cell phone, pager, and
satellite uplink. He is pleased with his ability to stay connected, even in
such a remote location. The woman, on the other hand, is sitting on the ground,
facing the mountain range, and looking unhappy. She tells the man that she
doesn't think he is connected at all.

The cartoon represents a criticism of the impact of technology and
digitalization on our daily lives. It shows how the man's dependence on
technology and gadgets has affected his ability to connect with the woman and
appreciate the natural surroundings. The woman's statement implies that the
man's reliance on technology has caused him to miss out on genuine
communication and connection with others.

The quote, "The more we elaborate our means of communication, the less we
communicate," by J.B. Priestley, is highly relevant to this cartoon. The first
part of the quote, "The more we elaborate our means of communication," is
represented by the man and his various communication devices. The second part
of the quote, "the less we communicate," is represented by the woman's
statement that the man is not really connected. This implies that despite the
many ways in which we can communicate with others today, we may actually be
communicating less effectively and genuinely.

In conclusion, the cartoon and the quote both criticize the negative impact of
technology and digitalization on our ability to communicate and connect with
others. They suggest that relying too heavily on technology can cause us to
miss out on authentic communication and appreciation of the world around us.


### Conclusion

The message presented by the quote and cartoon is that while technology has
improved our means of communication, it has also hindered our ability to
connect with others genuinely. The cartoon portrays the negative impact of the
man's dependence on technology, causing him to miss out on authentic
communication and appreciation of the natural world. The quote by J.B.
Priestley emphasizes this point by stating that the more we elaborate our means
of communication, the less we communicate. Overall, the message is a warning
about the potential consequences of relying too heavily on technology and the
importance of maintaining authentic connections with others and the world
around us.
