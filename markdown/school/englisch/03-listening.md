Comment:

In this comment, I'd like to share some of my thoughts on the importance of
conscious consuming and how we can all make a positive impact through our
everyday choices.

Introduction:

As our society becomes more and more consumer-driven, it's increasingly
important to consider the impact of our consumption habits on the planet and on
others. Conscious consuming is all about making intentional choices that
prioritize sustainability, ethics, and social responsibility.

Transition:

In my experience, conscious consuming has not only helped me reduce waste and
support ethical companies, but it's also brought a greater sense of purpose and
fulfillment to my life.

**Main part:**
The main arguments are always 'buy recycled stuff', 'buy fair trade'. But 
it is doubtful if it's them or rather it, the system that acts to be more 
concious than the others to trust. 

It's easy to keep the same lifestyle, with the same products, just making sure 
there's some 'consciousness' logo on the front you don't even know the background to,
if it's as good as the own name says it is. Given we live in a capitalistic society 
It's rather not.

So that said, that isn't an option.

We need to change our consumer behavior we adopted during all those years 
with media, an absurd amount 'social medias', and all the public figures
praying to the god of monetary advertising.

Otherwise we'll not get rid of it, not go anywhere.

You need to ask yourself 'Do I really need this?' instead of going for the 
pseudo better alternatives.



**nicht eigen:**
One of the key ways to practice conscious consuming is by choosing products
that are sustainably and ethically produced. This might mean looking for
certifications like Fair Trade or choosing products made from recycled
materials. It can also mean being mindful of the companies we support and their
practices, such as their treatment of workers or their carbon footprint.

Another important aspect of conscious consuming is reducing our overall
consumption and opting for quality over quantity. This might mean investing in
products that will last longer or repairing items rather than throwing them
away. It can also mean reducing our meat consumption or choosing products with
less packaging.

Of course, conscious consuming is not always easy or convenient. It can be
difficult to find ethical alternatives in certain industries, and there can be
social pressure to conform to certain consumption norms. However, I believe
that every small step we take towards more conscious consuming can have a
positive impact.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, conscious consuming is not just a personal choice, but a
collective responsibility. By making intentional choices that prioritize
sustainability, ethics, and social responsibility, we can all contribute to a
better world. I encourage everyone to reflect on their own consumption habits
and to consider how they can make a positive impact through conscious
consuming.
