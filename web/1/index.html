   <h3>Use of this website:</h3>
   <p>About the page: <br>
   The page is supposed to be just raw html5 and css without js and alike. To
   have less bloat which is useless either way, and helps it at being efficient
   (the supposed goal for life).<br>
   The goal of the content: <br>
   I don't know yet what to do with the content, probably some links to get rid
   of with time. Also going to have essays here and probably tutorials and
   documents.
