# Info

This is my repositry for notes, 25% of it made in school, the other 75% is stuff I did in free time.

It's mostly maths.



## system of the notes

The system I use consists of different smaller systems of https://castel.dev/ ,
in his blog together with his github you find the stuff detailed enough to set
it up. It got me inspired to use LaTeX for notetaking, and it's just great.
